The Covid 19 pandemic have had several short-term as well as long term impacts on human health, society, economy and environment. A pandemic which broke out in 2019 created significant knock-on effects on the daily life of citizens, as well as about the global economy.

Presently the impacts of COVID-19 in daily life are extensive and have far reaching consequences.
