# State-of-health-COVID 19 Data Exploration with SQL

The Covid 19 pandemic have had several short-term as well as long term impacts on human health, society, economy and environment. A pandemic which broke out in 2019 created significant knock-on effects on the daily life of citizens, as well as about the global economy.

Presently the impacts of COVID-19 in daily life are extensive and have far reaching consequences.

In this project, I analyzed and explored covid data with SQL using Micrsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

This covid-19 data was sourced from [[Our World in Data]](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) starting from 1st January, 2020 to 17th Septemberr, 2023

The following questions were answered in the project:
What is the likelihood of dying if you contract Covid?
What percentage of population infected with Covid?
Which countries have the highest infection rate compared to Population?
Which countries have the highest infection rate compared to Population?
Which countries have the highest death count per Population?
Which continent has the highest death count per Population?
What is are the total cases, total deaths, and death percentage across the world?
What is the global total Population against Vaccinations?
